# 🧠 Copilot Log Interpretation PoC

## Overview
This Proof of Concept explores how **Microsoft Copilot** on Windows can assist in **interpreting and summarizing application logs** directly from the desktop.  
The goal is to test whether AI can accelerate **bottom-up troubleshooting** by providing instant context, explanations, and possible resolutions for recurring log patterns — without specialized tools or external data connections.

## Concept
In traditional troubleshooting, log analysis can be time-consuming, requiring pattern recognition, documentation lookup, and manual correlation with known issues.  
This PoC approaches the problem *from the desktop upward*: using an AI assistant (Copilot) to read, summarize, and suggest meaning behind anonymized logs.

It complements the earlier *top-down monitoring* PoC using Grafana and Prometheus by focusing on **local intelligence and assistive reasoning** rather than system-level data aggregation.

## Approach
1. Collect anonymized logs from the local environment.  
2. Use Copilot to:
   - Summarize errors or warnings.
   - Explain likely causes.
   - Suggest next troubleshooting steps.
3. Compare the AI's reasoning with known resolutions or admin notes.

## Safety & Anonymization
All log samples are stripped of:
- Hostnames or system identifiers
- IP addresses or usernames
- Product or environment names

A PowerShell or Python script can perform this basic anonymization before testing.

## Results Tracking
Each Copilot test is documented in `results/copilot_responses.md` with:
- Log snippet tested
- Prompt used
- AI output summary
- Human validation comment

## Future Work
- Compare Copilot interpretations vs human admin notes
- Test with multiple log types (application, system, network)
- Measure time savings or accuracy improvement
